 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.094   TIME= 15:25:43
 Using 1 iteration per substep may result in unconverged solutions for   
 nonlinear analysis and the program may not indicate divergence in this  
 case.  Check your results.                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.219   TIME= 15:25:43
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.672   TIME= 15:25:43
 Material number 8 (used by element 23264 ) should normally have at      
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       4.562   TIME= 15:25:44
 Maximum contact stiffness 2.116814456E+16 is too big which can cause an 
 accuracy problem, you may scale the force units in the model.
